# web-scraping-challenge
## Scraping
Initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter
## MondoDB and Flask
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs

Note: test_mars.py is just the scrape code not built as a function. I included it in the repository if there was a MongoDB based problem, but the scrape_mars.py is the script that is actually called with the app.
